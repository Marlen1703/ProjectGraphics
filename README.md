--VISE---

Our example of this simple machine is a model of a vise. The model prints in just two parts: the upper crossbar and the rest of the model. 
The knob to turn the screw is printed in place(captive).This is an example of a model that is not really possible to create any other way
than by 3D printing it(if it is being fabricated in one piece, anyway).
The printed vise  of course is not strong enough to use for anything that will exert a lot of force
but it be interesting to play with and get some intuition about the relationships between the things you can vary for this model.
